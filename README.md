#Ionic angular seed with grunt and feature folders

I really like Ionic Framework, but I'd rather use grunt with my project and feature folder aproach "a la ngBoilerplate" instead of the one currently used by seed. That's why I've created this seed project which is based half in ionic-seed and half in ngBoilerplate. 

Thanks to both of them for creating this great libraries/seed projects.

This is released under MIT license and can be used with Ionic alpha for now. 

I'll try to keep this updated :).
